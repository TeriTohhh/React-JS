1. Emmet is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allows for high-speed coding and editing in HTML, XML, XSLT, and other structured code formats via content assist.

2. Library : It is collection of fuctions and classes , We can say that a library implements a particular function. 
   Framework: We can define a framework as a collection of libraries implementing a particular methodology.

3. The primary purpose of a content delivery network (cdn) is to reduce latency, or reduce the delay in communication created by a network's design. 

4.It is meant to help developers build user interfaces that are fast and responsive, or “reactive.

5.A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.

6.React is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces and 
  ReactDOM is the JavaScript library that allows React to interact with the DOM.

7.  react.development.js - More developer friendly, readable, will take more size.
  react.production.js - Minified code that is not developer friendly as it focused on decreasing in file size, code efficiency.

  CDN is the Content Delivery Network that provides you with the respective JS file online.

8. Async
        Downloads in the background at a low priority (same as defer)
        Can interrupt page rendering to execute
        Executes as soon as possible and in no particular order
    
    Defer
        Downloads in the background at a low priority (same as async)
        Won't interrupt page rendering to execute
        Executes in sequence just before the DOMContentLoaded event
